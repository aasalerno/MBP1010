MBP1010 Winter 2014 - Assignment #1
===================================
Student Name: Anthony_Salerno
Notes: Your answer should take the form of a single R script that, when run, outputs *only* the
       information indicated in the questions below, and in exactly that order. Each question will
       be worth 1% and the entire assignment will be worth 7%



Question #1: Directory Path Handling
One critical thing to do in analyzing a dataset is to keep a clean and neat directory structure
with all your files in logical and easily traceable locations. Create a directory on your machine
called Assignments. Within that directory create a subdirectory called assignment1.  Copy
this file into that directory.  Note that these directory names should be exact, including
capitalization. Finally, start a new R script called assignment1_script.R.  In this script, change the
working directory to assignment1 and then print the current working directory to screen.


Question #2: Directory Listing
Now use an R command to print the list of files found in assignment1 to screen.


Question #3: File Input I
Next we will look at opening files: starting by saving Assignment1-data.txt to assignment1 however you
like. Open Assignment1-data.txt in R, saving it as a variable. Note that Assignment1-data.txt
contains row names and column names, which you will need to handle correctly.  Now print the name
of row 12 to screen in R.


Question #4: File Input II
Now print to screen the dimensions of this variable.


Question #5: File Input III
Finally, print to screen the contents of the cell in [12, 8].


Question #6: File Input IV - calculating summary measures
Now we will print a summary characteristic.  Using any approach you like, calculate the mean
of row 12 and print it to screen.


Question #7: File Output
Finally, multiply each cell of your data by -1 and save this into a new variable.
Write the resulting object to file as a tab-delimited file with intact row and column names.
